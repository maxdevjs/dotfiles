  I am particularly excited about <a href="https://www.serpentos.com/">Serpent OS</a>, a distro from the original creator of <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus</a> that should be available in the foreseeable future.
  
  
  <a href ="https://gitlab.com/serpent-os/core/moss#inspiration">Inspired</a> by a number of tools, including (but not limited to):

 - <a href ="https://getsol.us/articles/package-management/basics/en/">eopkg</a>/<a href ="https://github.com/solus-project/package-management/tree/master/pisi">pisi</a>

  - ~~old, currently unavailable~~ currently in use after [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) update went üò°
    - I A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y üíï [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/)
      - ~~I am just lazy to revamp the related `dotfiles`~~ [maxdevjs/dotfiles-solus-config](https://github.com/maxdevjs/dotfiles-solus-config)
        - did I say that I üíì [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/)?
          - üòç
            - even if I preferred as it was a few years ago (look at the `Spoiler`) 
- [maxdevjs/dotfiles-nixos](https://github.com/maxdevjs/dotfiles-nixos)
  - ~~currently in use~~ installation broke updating to `21.05`, `temporarily` on hold üòÅ
- `maxdevjs/dotfiles-void`
  - old, currently unavailable
    - if I will start to sparingly use [The Void (Linux) distribution](https://voidlinux.org/) again
      - `maxdevjs/dotfiles-void` will be revamped, most likely
        - interesting points: used [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
          - unfortunately, seems that these two amazing pieces of software are lagging behind in recent times
            - anyway... [maxdevjs/dotfiles-bspwm-config](https://github.com/maxdevjs/dotfiles-bspwm-config) [maxdevjs/dotfiles-sxhkd-config](https://github.com/maxdevjs/dotfiles-sxhkd-config)
