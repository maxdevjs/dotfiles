## dotfiles à la carte

- [maxdevjs/dotfiles-nixos](https://github.com/maxdevjs/dotfiles-nixos)
  - currently in use
- `maxdevjs/dotfiles-void`
  - old, currently unavailable
    - if I will start to sparingly use [The Void (Linux) distribution](https://voidlinux.org/) again
      - `maxdevjs/dotfiles-void` will be revamped, most likely
        - interesting points: used [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
          - unfortunately, seems that these two amazing pieces of software are lagging behind in recent times
- `maxdevjs/dotfiles-solus`
  - old, currently unavailable
    - I A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y 💕 [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/)
      - I am just lazy to revamp the related `dotfiles`
        - did I say that I 💓 [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/)?
          - 😍
